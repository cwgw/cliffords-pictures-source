> My grandfather took a lot of pictures. He had a Polaroid instant camera hanging from his neck at every Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthday and barbecue.
>
> He passed a few years ago, and we discovered about a thousand photos in bags and boxes. I decided to scan them and put them on the web to share with my family.
>
> If you're curious you can see the site at [cliffords.pictures](https://cliffords.pictures).

This repo contains all of the scans, as well as a node-based cli tool that processes the scans and prepares them for the web.
